### Notes

* Editing save files makes the achievements still unlockable
* There are still a few weird bugs that need to be ironed out. If you find anything that needs fixed, please report it under the issues tab!

#### Save file locations

* Mac OS: ~/Library/Application Support/Steam/steamapps/common/SlayTheSpire/SlayTheSpire.app/Contents/Resources/saves
  * You will need to use 'Show Package Contents' on `SlayTheSpire.app`

Or use the 'Browse Local Files' feature of Steam to find your save game location.

##### Thank you all for your support and stay safe in the spire!
